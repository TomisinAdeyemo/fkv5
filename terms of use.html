        <p>Welcome to FindersKeepers!FindersKeepers is where meaningful connections can happen. It Starts With a Swipe™. 
            Sometimes you click. Sometimes you don’t. And sometimes the talking leads to more. Opportunity is overflowing. 
            Possibilities are endless. All (adults) are welcome to come explore.
         </p>
        <p>We want FindersKeepers to be a fun, safe and inclusive space where anyone can be themselves while getting </p>
        <p>to know others. That’s what these Community Guidelines are for–to set expectations for everyone’s behavior, 
            both on and off of the app. So read on; not following these guidelines can have real consequences-from a nudge to a ban.</p>

        <ul class="bullet-points">
            <li class="list1">Age. You need to be at least 18 years old to join Bumble. Creating a profile that intentionally misrepresents you as being under the age of 18 is not allowed. We reserve the right to ask for your ID to verify your age, and we’ll block you from the platform if you’re underage.</li>
            <li class="list1">Profile Photos. We want your profile to celebrate your authentic self! That’s why we require at least one of your profile photos to depict only you and to clearly show your full face. We do not permit:</li>
            <li class="list1"> Profile photos that are heavily distorted or contain exaggerated or unnatural digital effects to the point where it cannot be clearly determined that you’re the person in the photos</li>
            <li class="list1">Any overlaid symbols, icons, frames, or stickers that aren’t from Bumble on your profile photos
                Memes or photos with only — or primarily — text as a profile photo</li>

        <h1 class="center-text">Platform Manipulation</h1>

        <p>We prioritise fostering a community built on genuine connections, so any attempts to artificially influence connections, 
            matching, conversations, or engagement through the use of automation or scripting is strictly prohibited.

        <h1 class="center-text">Safety Reporting</h1>

        <p>Safety is a top priority at Bumble. We use a combination of human moderators and automated systems to monitor and review Bumble accounts and interactions for content that may be against our Community Guidelines, against our Terms and Conditions, or otherwise harmful.

            Our members play a critical role in the safety of Bumble by reporting content or behavior that may violate our Community Guidelines. If anything happens that makes you feel uncomfortable or unsafe, we highly encourage you to Unmatch with – or Block & Report – the member. 
            
            However, please consider that disagreeing with or disliking a member or their content is not necessarily a reason to report them. 
            We may take action against a member if we’e found them to be intentionally creating false or inappropriate reports against other members solely 
            based on their protected attributes. This includes reporting transgender or nonbinary members for no reason other than their gender identity or 
            expression or repeatedly sending false reports of bad behaviour.

    <section class="content-section3">
        <!-- Centered h1 Text -->
        <h1 class="center-text">Enforcement Philosophy</h1>

        <p>All members must comply with the platform rules described and referenced in our Community Guidelines. If you behave in a way that goes against Bumble’s Community Guidelines, values, or otherwise act in any way we believe to be potentially harmful to Bumble or its members, we may take a range of actions on your account. When determining the penalty for violating our community guidelines, we consider a number of factors.
            For example, we may: Remove the content ,Issue a warning, Ban the offending member.
            
            When necessary, we also may cooperate with law enforcement to assist in potential criminal investigations related to member conduct.
            
            Your treatment towards others outside of the Bumble app can also result in action against your account. If we’re made aware of harm 
            between members on dates, meetups with friends, via text message or direct messaging platforms, or relevant alleged criminal or harmful 
            conduct committed in your past or outside of Bumble, we may take action as if it happened on our platform.
